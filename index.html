Poverty is often linked to lack of access<br>to basic needs such as education, healthcare, clean water, and economic<br> opportunities. Adressing poverty can contribute to reducing inequality and promoting social justice.</p>

    <h1><strong>How Bad Poverty Gets.</strong></h1>

    <p>This image shows a young child sitting in an environment that reflects<br> extreme poverty, a direct connection to the global Sustainable Development Goal<br> of "No Poverty." The makeshift surroundings, which include scattered debris,<br> bricks, and worn-out household items, indicate inadequate living conditions. <br>The child appears to lack access to basic necessities such as proper shelter,<br> clothing, and sanitation, underscoring the need for urgent social and<br> economic support. Achieving the "No Poverty" goal aims to eliminate<br> such situations, ensuring that children and families have access to stable housing,<br> nutrition, education, and healthcare to break the cycle of poverty.</p>
