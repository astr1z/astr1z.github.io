    <p class="text2">A software development module introduces the fundamental concepts of creating,<br> testing, and maintaining software applications. It covers topics like <strong>algorithms,<br> data structures, and object-oriented programming</strong>, which are essential for building<br> efficient and scalable systems. Python is often used in these modules because of<br> its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Itâ€™s beginner-friendly yet powerful<br> enough for complex projects, making it an ideal language for both newcomers and<br> experienced developers. <strong>Python</strong> supports multiple programming model/paterns and is<br> widely used in web development, data science, and automation. Its flexibility<br> and ease of use helps developers quickly turn ideas into functioning <strong>software!</strong></p>
